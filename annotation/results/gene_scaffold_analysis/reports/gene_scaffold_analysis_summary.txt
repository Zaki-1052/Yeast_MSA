Main Conclusions:
---------------
1. This analysis identifies genes with high variant density across treatments.
2. Several genes show treatment-specific enrichment of variants.
3. The pattern of variant distribution provides insights into adaptation mechanisms.
4. Temperature and low oxygen adaptations show distinct gene impact patterns.
5. Gene modifications (STC, CAS) appear to influence gene variant patterns.
6. Further analysis of enriched genes may reveal functional implications of adaptations.
