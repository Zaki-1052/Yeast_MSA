Main Conclusions:
---------------
1. This analysis examines the sequence context of mutations in different treatments.
2. The mutational signatures reveal preferred sequence contexts for mutations.
3. Adaptation types (Temperature vs Low Oxygen) show distinct mutational patterns.
4. Gene modifications (STC/CAS) influence the sequence context preferences.
5. The analysis of enriched trinucleotide contexts provides insights into the
   mechanisms of mutagenesis and DNA damage repair under different conditions.
6. Sequence logos reveal position-specific nucleotide preferences around mutations.
