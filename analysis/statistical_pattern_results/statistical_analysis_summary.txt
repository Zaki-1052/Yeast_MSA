Biological Context Summary:
-------------------------
This analysis examines mutation patterns in yeast strains under different conditions:

  WT-37: Temperature-adapted wild type - Temperature adaptation
  WTA: Low oxygen-adapted wild type - Low Oxygen adaptation
  STC: STC gene with low oxygen adaptation - Low Oxygen adaptation with STC gene insertion
  CAS: CAS gene with temperature adaptation - Temperature adaptation with CAS gene insertion

Main Conclusions:
---------------
1. This analysis examines statistical patterns in the variant data.
2. Principal Component Analysis identifies major axes of variation between treatments.
3. Correlation analysis reveals relationships between mutation types and treatments.
4. Regression models evaluate the relationship between genomic features and variant density.
5. Clustering analysis identifies groups of scaffolds with similar variant patterns.
6. Comparisons between adaptation types (temperature vs. low oxygen) reveal
   differences in mutation patterns and genomic distributions.
7. Gene-modified strains (STC, CAS) show specific mutation characteristics
   compared to their non-modified counterparts (WTA, WT-37).
