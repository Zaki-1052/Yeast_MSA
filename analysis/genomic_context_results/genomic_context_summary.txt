Main Conclusions:
---------------
1. This analysis examines the local sequence context around mutation sites.
2. We analyze GC content, homopolymer regions, and repetitive elements near variants.
3. Adaptation types (Temperature vs Low Oxygen) show different patterns
   in their local sequence contexts.
4. Gene modifications (STC/CAS) influence the genomic context of mutations.
5. Temperature adaptation shows distinct patterns in sequence composition
   compared to low oxygen adaptation.
6. Gene-modified strains exhibit different local sequence features compared
   to non-modified strains, suggesting specific mutational mechanisms.
