Main Conclusions:
---------------
1. This analysis examines the genomic context of mutations in different treatments.
2. The GC content analysis reveals potential biases in mutation distribution.
3. Homopolymer and repeat regions may influence mutation probability.
4. Adaptation conditions (Temperature vs Low Oxygen) show distinct context preferences.
5. Gene modifications (STC, CAS) appear to influence the genomic context of mutations.
6. Sequence composition around mutation sites provides insights into damage mechanisms.
7. Further analysis of specific motifs may reveal specific DNA damage signatures.
