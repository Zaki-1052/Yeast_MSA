Gene-Specific Population Structure Conclusions:
-------------------------------------------
1. This analysis examines the genetic relationships between samples with a focus on gene-level variants.
2. Variants were mapped to genes based on genomic coordinates using the W303 yeast reference.
3. 0.0% of variants occur within annotated genes.
5. Gene-specific population structure analysis provides deeper biological insights
   into the genetic basis of adaptation in these yeast strains.
