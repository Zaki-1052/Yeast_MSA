## Biological Interpretations

- **Core Promoter Focus**: A higher proportion of variants occur in core promoter regions, suggesting adaptation through changes in basal transcription machinery recruitment and transcription initiation.
- **Hierarchical Regulatory Architecture**: The distribution of variants across different regulatory regions and conservation zones reveals a hierarchical structure that balances essential function preservation with adaptive flexibility.
