## Biological Interpretations

- **Distal Regulatory Focus**: A higher proportion of variants occur in distal regulatory regions rather than coding regions, suggesting adaptation primarily through changes in gene regulation rather than protein structure.
- **Temperature Adaptation Strategy**: Temperature adaptation shows a higher proportion of coding missense variants (30.3% vs 8.3%), suggesting protein-level adaptation plays a stronger role in response to thermal stress compared to oxygen limitation.
- **Variant Distribution Range**: Variants occur at distances ranging from 3034.0bp to 44512.0bp from ERG genes, demonstrating a broad spatial distribution of genetic changes that may affect ergosterol pathway function.
- **Effect Type Distribution**: The variants show a mix of coding changes (15 variants, 33.3%) and regulatory changes (30 variants, 66.7%), highlighting how adaptation involves both protein-level and gene expression mechanisms.
- **Hierarchical Regulatory Architecture**: The distribution of variants across different regulatory regions and conservation zones reveals a hierarchical structure that balances essential function preservation with adaptive flexibility.
