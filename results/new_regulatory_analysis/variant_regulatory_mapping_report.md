## Biological Interpretations

- **Upstream Activating Sequence Focus**: A higher proportion of variants occur in UAS regions, suggesting adaptation through changes in binding of specific transcription factors and condition-responsive gene regulation.
- **Hierarchical Regulatory Architecture**: The distribution of variants across different regulatory regions and conservation zones reveals a hierarchical structure that balances essential function preservation with adaptive flexibility.
