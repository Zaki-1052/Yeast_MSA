# Implementation Update 2: Gene-Specific Regulatory Analysis

## Overview

Building on our previous implementation work, we have successfully created a new analysis module specifically focused on gene variants rather than scaffold variants. This module, located in `scripts/specific_regulatory_analysis/`, analyzes the regulatory patterns of variants that are directly associated with genes of interest, particularly those in the ergosterol pathway.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Specialized Gene Variant Analysis

We've implemented a complete analysis pipeline specifically for gene variants:

- **Data Source**: Uses `results/gene_variants/all_gene_variants.tsv` instead of scaffold variants
- **Focus**: Analyzes variants specifically associated with genes, with precise distance information
- **Effect-Based Analysis**: Categorizes variants based on their actual effect types (missense, synonymous, upstream regulatory)
- **Treatment Group Awareness**: Handles replicate samples (e.g., WT-37-55-1) correctly by mapping them to their base treatment groups

### 2. Effect-Based Classification

Rather than using arbitrary distance-based thresholds for regulatory region classification, the updated implementation:

- Extracts actual effect types from the variant data
- Classifies variants as coding_missense, coding_synonymous, coding_frameshift, or distal_regulatory based on their Effect field
- Performs statistical analysis on these effect types across treatment groups

### 3. Accurate Distance Reporting

Unlike previous implementations, this version:
- Reports accurate distance statistics (mean 180.4bp, median 116.0bp, range 89-332bp)
- These distances reflect the actual proximity of these gene variants to the genes they affect
- Shows a closer relationship between these variants and gene function compared to scaffold variants

### 4. Treatment Group Analysis Improvements

The treatment group comparison now:
- Analyzes effect type distributions rather than arbitrary regulatory region classifications
- Properly compares Temperature vs. Low Oxygen adaptation patterns
- Correctly handles replicate naming patterns (e.g., treating WT-37-55-1 as part of the WT-37 group)

## Findings

The gene-specific analysis reveals:

1. **Effect Distribution**: Unlike scaffold variants which showed a mix of effect types (66.7% regulatory, 33.3% coding), the gene variants are exclusively regulatory (100% upstream gene variants).

2. **Distance Relationship**: Gene variants are much closer to their target genes (mean 180.4bp) compared to scaffold variants (mean 21841.8bp), suggesting a more direct regulatory role.

3. **Treatment Pattern Consistency**: All treatment groups show similar patterns of regulatory variants, with 62.5-66.7% in core promoter regions and 33.3-37.5% in UAS proximal regions.

4. **Consistent Core Promoter Focus**: Across all treatments, there is a consistent enrichment for variants in core promoter regions (~66.7%) compared to UAS proximal regions (~33.3%).

## Biological Interpretation

These findings support a refined model of adaptation:

1. **Precise Regulatory Changes**: The adaptation in these genes appears to occur through very precise regulatory changes located close to the genes (mean 180.4bp).

2. **Core Promoter Mechanism**: The prevalence of variants in core promoter regions (62.5-66.7%) suggests adaptation primarily through changes to basal transcription machinery recruitment.

3. **Regulatory Over Coding**: The complete absence of coding variants in this gene-specific dataset suggests strong purifying selection on coding regions of these specific genes, with adaptation occurring exclusively through regulatory changes.

4. **Hierarchical Architecture**: These findings continue to support the hierarchical conservation model, showing that essential genes adapt through nearby regulatory changes rather than coding modifications.

## Implementation Files

- `scripts/specific_regulatory_analysis/fix_variant_annotations.py`: Processes the gene variants dataset
- `scripts/specific_regulatory_analysis/variant_regulatory_mapping.py`: Maps variants to regulatory features
- `scripts/specific_regulatory_analysis/treatment_regulatory_analysis.py`: Analyzes treatment-specific patterns

## Next Steps

With this implementation complete, we can now proceed with:

1. **Combined Analysis**: Integrate the findings from both scaffold-level and gene-specific analyses to build a more comprehensive model of adaptation
2. **ERG-OSH Regulatory Relationship Analysis**: Examine regulatory relationships between ERG and OSH genes
3. **Regulatory Impact Score System**: Develop a scoring system for evaluating the potential impact of regulatory variants
4. **Four-Zone Integration Analysis**: Connect these findings with the four-zone conservation architecture model

These gene-specific findings provide important complementary information to our previous scaffold-level analysis, showing how adaptation operates at different genomic scales.
