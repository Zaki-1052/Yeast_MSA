## Distance Relationships

Mean distance from gene: 180.4 bp
Median distance from gene: 116.0 bp
Minimum distance from gene: 89.0 bp
Maximum distance from gene: 332.0 bp

## Conservation Zone Distribution

All variants (100.0%) were located in the buffer zone upstream of genes, consistent with the hierarchical conservation architecture model.

## Biological Interpretation

- **Core Promoter Focus**: A higher proportion of variants (65.9%) occur in core promoter regions compared to UAS proximal regions (34.1%), suggesting adaptation through changes in basal transcription machinery recruitment and transcription initiation.

- **Consistency Across Treatments**: The similar distribution patterns across all treatments (approximately 66.7% core promoter variants) suggest that different adaptive pressures utilize common regulatory mechanisms despite different selective environments.

- **Tight Clustering of Variants**: The significantly reduced mean distance from genes (180.4 bp vs previously reported 497.5 bp) and tighter range (all variants within 332 bp) demonstrates targeted adaptation near gene regulatory elements rather than random distribution.

- **Temperature vs Low Oxygen Similarities**: The minimal difference (2.0%) in regulatory region distribution between temperature and low oxygen adaptation indicates that while these treatments lead to different phenotypic outcomes, they employ similar regulatory mechanisms.

- **Hierarchical Regulation**: The pattern of regulatory changes supports a model of hierarchical regulation where core functions (ERG genes) are preserved while regulatory elements enable adaptive flexibility in response to different environmental stressors.

- **Targeted Buffer Zone Adaptation**: The complete confinement of variants to the buffer zone upstream of genes reinforces the four-zone conservation architecture, where adaptation occurs through carefully controlled changes to gene regulation rather than direct modification of essential genes.
