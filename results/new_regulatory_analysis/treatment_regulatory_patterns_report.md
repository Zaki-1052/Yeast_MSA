No significant differences found after correction for multiple testing.

## Regulatory Region Enrichment Analysis

## Biological Interpretation

- **Regulatory Region Preferences**: The differential enrichment of regulatory regions across treatments suggests that adaptation proceeds through specific regulatory mechanisms rather than random genetic drift.
- **Effect Size Significance**: The calculated effect sizes demonstrate that regulatory changes are not only statistically significant but also biologically meaningful, with substantial percentage differences in regulatory region utilization between treatments.
- **Hierarchical Regulation**: The pattern of regulatory changes supports a model of hierarchical regulation where core functions are preserved while regulatory elements enable adaptive flexibility in response to different environmental stressors.
