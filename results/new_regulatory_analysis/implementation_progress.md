# New Regulatory Analysis Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation progress of the new regulatory analysis framework outlined in `plan.md`. The implementation follows a structured approach to create a more comprehensive framework for analyzing regulatory regions in the Yeast MSA project.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Enhanced Regulatory Region Definition Framework

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Implementation:**
- Created a robust framework for defining regulatory regions with higher precision based on yeast genomic features
- Incorporated known regulatory elements from literature and databases
- Developed a comprehensive map of potential regulatory regions around genes
- Created conservation zones (core, buffer, intermediate, satellite) based on distance from critical genes
- Generated detailed visualizations and reports

**Files Created:**
- `/scripts/new_regulatory_analysis/regulatory_region_definition.py`
- `/scripts/new_regulatory_analysis/data/regulatory_features.json`

**Key Features:**
- Precise definitions for promoters, UTRs, enhancers, and other regulatory elements
- Hierarchical classification of regulatory regions
- Integration with known yeast promoter architecture
- Support for both ERG and OSH gene analysis
- Comprehensive reporting and statistics

- Gene regulatory map with detailed annotations
- Region statistics and visualizations
- Comprehensive report detailing the regulatory region definitions

### 2. Advanced Variant-to-Regulatory Feature Mapping System

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Implementation:**
- Created a system to map variants to specific regulatory features with high precision
- Developed classification by potential regulatory impact
- Implemented distance relationship quantification to transcription start sites
- Added support for TFBS (Transcription Factor Binding Site) analysis

**Files Created:**
- `/scripts/new_regulatory_analysis/variant_regulatory_mapping.py`

**Key Features:**
- Precise mapping of variants to regulatory regions
- Classification of variants by regulatory type and impact
- TFBS identification and impact analysis
- Comprehensive visualization and statistics
- Integration with conservation zones

**Output:**
- Detailed mapping of variants to regulatory features
- Statistical analysis of variant distribution
- Visualizations of regulatory patterns
- Comprehensive mapping report

### 3. Treatment-Specific Regulatory Pattern Analysis

**Status:** ✅ Completed Successfully

**Implementation:**
- Developed a comprehensive system for analyzing regulatory patterns specific to treatments
- Implemented comparison between temperature and low oxygen adaptation
- Added analysis of gene modification effects
- Created statistical validation framework for pattern significance
- Generated reports and visualizations

**Files Created:**
- `/scripts/new_regulatory_analysis/treatment_regulatory_analysis.py`

**Key Features:**
- Treatment distribution analysis
- Treatment group comparison
- Enrichment analysis for regulatory elements
- Effect size calculation
- Comprehensive reporting

**Updates and Fixes:**
The previous implementation had limitations due to incomplete test data. These issues have now been resolved with the following improvements:

1. **Fixed Variant Calling**: The variant calling and treatment data assignment have been corrected, resulting in a complete dataset with all treatment samples (WT-37, WTA, CAS, STC) and controls.

2. **Expanded Dataset**: The analysis now includes 44 total variants (up from 12), providing a more comprehensive view of regulatory patterns.

3. **Complete Treatment Representation**: All treatment samples are now properly represented with multiple replicates (e.g., CAS-55-1, CAS-55-2, CAS-55-3), allowing for more robust statistical analysis.

4. **Treatment Group Comparisons**: Successfully generated comparisons between treatment groups (Temperature vs. Low Oxygen, Gene Modified vs. Non-Modified) with detailed statistical analysis.

**Key Findings:**
- Core promoter regions show a higher proportion of variants (65.9%) compared to UAS proximal regions (34.1%)
- All observed variants are located in the buffer zone upstream of genes
- Mean distance from genes decreased to 180.4 bp (from 497.5 bp previously)
- Treatment-specific patterns show similar distributions across treatments with approximately 66.7% of variants in core promoter regions

### 4. Next Steps

The remaining tasks in the plan are:
- Develop ERG-OSH Regulatory Relationship Analysis
- Implement Statistical Validation Framework
- Build Regulatory Impact Score System
- Create Four-Zone Integration Analysis
- Develop Visualization and Reporting System

## Conclusion

The implementation of the new regulatory analysis framework is proceeding according to plan, with the first three components now successfully implemented. The fixed variant calling has significantly improved the quality and completeness of the analysis, providing a more accurate picture of regulatory patterns across different treatments.

The analysis now reveals consistent regulatory patterns across all treatment conditions (WT-37, WTA, CAS, STC), with a focus on core promoter regions. This suggests that adaptation to different environmental stresses involves similar regulatory mechanisms despite different selective pressures.

To proceed, we will:
1. Continue implementing the remaining components
2. Integrate the treatment-specific findings with the other analysis modules
3. Expand the analysis to examine ERG-OSH regulatory relationships
4. Develop a comprehensive regulatory impact scoring system

These steps will ensure a thorough and biologically relevant analysis of the regulatory patterns in the Yeast MSA project, providing valuable insights into the adaptive mechanisms of yeast under different environmental conditions.
