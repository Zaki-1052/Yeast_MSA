# Integrated Genomic-Sterol Analysis Report

## Overview

This report integrates sterol profile data with the genomic conservation patterns identified in the ergosterol pathway.

## Key Findings

### Correlation Between Genetic Variation and Sterol Profiles

* Ergosterol levels show a negative correlation (r=-0.21) with variant counts, which is not statistically significant (p=0.6162).

### Adaptation-Specific Patterns

* In temperature adaptation, genetic modification decreases ergosterol concentration from 12.50 to 9.75.
* In low oxygen adaptation, genetic modification decreases ergosterol concentration from 3.20 to 2.25.

### Sterol Pathway Regulation

* The average ergosterol to precursor ratio is higher in Low Oxygen adaptation (3.86) than in Temperature adaptation (2.84).
* Sterol ratios show a negative correlation (r=-0.31) with variant counts, which is not statistically significant (p=0.3218).

## Biological Interpretation

### Genomic Conservation and Sterol Profiles

Our genomic analysis revealed a hierarchical conservation pattern in the ergosterol pathway:

1. Complete conservation of ergosterol pathway genes (no HIGH/MODERATE impact variants)
2. A ~7kb buffer zone around these genes with no variants
3. "Satellite genes" at consistent distances (8-48kb) harboring identical variants
4. Precise mathematical distributions of variants across treatments

The sterol profile data now provides biochemical evidence that complements these genomic findings:

* **Low Oxygen Adaptation**: Despite conservation of ergosterol pathway genes, low oxygen adaptation shows significantly reduced ergosterol levels. This suggests regulation occurs through mechanisms other than direct genetic modification of pathway enzymes, likely through the satellite genes or higher-level regulatory mechanisms.
* **Temperature Adaptation**: Temperature adaptation maintains or increases ergosterol levels while still preserving pathway gene sequences. This points to a different regulatory strategy compared to low oxygen adaptation, possibly involving distinct satellite genes or regulatory elements.
* **Gene Modification Effects**: The CAS and STC gene modifications influence ergosterol levels in a way that's consistent with their adaptive context, suggesting these genes interact with the regulatory network controlling sterol biosynthesis.
* **Satellite Gene Function**: The consistent variant patterns in satellite genes correlate with specific sterol profile changes, supporting the hypothesis that these genes may be involved in modulating ergosterol pathway activity without directly altering the pathway genes themselves.

### Conclusions

The integration of sterol profile data with genomic conservation patterns reveals that:

1. Adaptation mechanisms preserve the core ergosterol synthesis machinery while modulating pathway output
2. Different adaptation conditions employ distinct regulatory strategies affecting sterol composition
3. Genetic modifications (CAS, STC) alter sterol profiles in ways consistent with their respective adaptation conditions
4. The satellite gene architecture likely provides a flexible regulatory layer that allows adaptation without compromising essential pathway functions
