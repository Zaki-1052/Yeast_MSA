# Sterol Analysis Progress Update

## Completed Analysis Steps

1. **Preprocessing (complete)**
   - Standardized sterol data with treatment, generation, and adaptation metadata
   - Calculated relative abundances
   - Generated basic visualizations of sterol distributions
   - Identified initial patterns in ergosterol levels and sterol diversity

2. **Comparative Analysis (complete)**
   - Performed statistical testing of key differences
   - Quantified fold changes between conditions
   - Analyzed sterol diversity and unique sterols by treatment
   - Created comprehensive visualizations comparing treatments
   - Generated summary of findings

## Next Steps and Adjustments

Based on our findings from the comparative analysis, we should adjust the pathway analysis approach to focus on:

1. **Enhanced Pathway Mapping**
   - Given the specific sterols we've identified (especially Tetrahymanol, Stigmasta-5_22-dien-3-ol_acetate), 
     we need to ensure our pathway mapping correctly positions these in relation to the ergosterol pathway
   - Tetrahymanol appears to be a unique marker for low oxygen adaptation in STC

2. **Treatment-Specific Flux Analysis**
   - Focus on comparing relative pathway flux between temperature and low oxygen adaptation
   - Assess how the presence of sterols at different points in the pathway suggests regulatory changes

3. **Gene-Modification Effects on Pathway**
   - Analyze how gene modifications (CAS, STC) influence specific steps in the pathway
   - Investigate whether modifications create alternative branches or favor certain intermediates

4. **Integration Focus Points**
   - Ensure the integration with genomic data specifically addresses the relationships between:
     - Conservation of pathway genes and the variety of sterol profiles
     - Satellite gene variants and unique sterols
     - Adaptation-specific genomic patterns and sterol composition differences

These adjustments will help ensure that the pathway analysis and subsequent integration build directly on the insights gained from our comparative analysis.
