# Sterol Profiles in Relation to Genomic Conservation Patterns

## Conservation Zones and Sterol Profiles
Our genomic analysis identified a hierarchical conservation pattern with four zones:
- **Core Zone**: Ergosterol genes themselves - Absolute conservation
- **Buffer Zone**: 0-7kb: Strong conservation, no variants
- **Satellite Zone**: 7-50kb: Specific genes harboring consistent variants
- **Distant Zone**: >50kb: Less constrained

## 3. Integration with Genomic Conservation Model
The integration of sterol profiles with genomic conservation patterns provides strong evidence for how yeast adapts despite strong purifying selection on the ergosterol pathway:

1. **Core Conservation with Phenotypic Adaptation**: While ergosterol pathway genes show complete conservation (no HIGH/MODERATE impact variants), we observe significant differences in sterol profiles between adaptation types (3.76× higher ergosterol in temperature adaptation).

2. **Satellite Gene Regulation**: The satellite genes identified in our genomic analysis likely influence ergosterol pathway regulation, as evidenced by treatment-specific sterol markers like Tetrahymanol (STC, low oxygen adaptation) and Stigmasta-5_22-dien-3-ol_acetate (CAS, temperature adaptation).

3. **Alternative Pathway Utilization**: Different adaptation types show distinct pathway flux patterns, with temperature adaptation maintaining high ergosterol production and low oxygen adaptation utilizing alternative sterols.

4. **Gene Modification Amplifies Variation**: Gene-modified strains show 2.25× higher sterol diversity, suggesting that modifications to genes create even greater metabolic flexibility while preserving essential pathway functions.

This hierarchical conservation model represents an elegant evolutionary strategy that balances essential function preservation with metabolic flexibility needed for adaptation to different environmental stressors.
