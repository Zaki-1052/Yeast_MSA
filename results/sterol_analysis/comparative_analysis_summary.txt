# Comparative Sterol Analysis Summary

## Key Findings

### 1. Adaptation-Specific Ergosterol Differences
- **Statistically significant** difference in ergosterol levels between adaptation types (p = 0.0109)
- Temperature-adapted strains have **3.76x higher ergosterol** than low oxygen-adapted strains
- Temperature adaptation: 10.25 (mean concentration)
- Low oxygen adaptation: 2.73 (mean concentration)

### 2. Gene Modification Effects
- No significant difference in ergosterol levels between modified and non-modified strains (p = 0.7879)
- However, gene-modified strains show **greater sterol diversity** (4.5 vs 3.0 sterols, 1.5x difference)
- Gene-modified strains contain more unique sterols:
  - CAS has 5 unique sterols not found in other treatments
  - STC has 1 unique sterol (Tetrahymanol)

### 3. Treatment-Specific Sterol Profiles
- CAS (gene-modified, temperature-adapted): Highest sterol diversity (7 sterols)
  - Unique sterols: Stigmasta-5_22-dien-3-ol_acetate, Ergosta-7-en-3-ol, Lanosterol, Ergost-7-en-3beta-ol, Cycloartenol
  - High ergosterol (9.75)
- STC (gene-modified, low oxygen-adapted): Lowest diversity (2 sterols)
  - Contains unique sterol: Tetrahymanol (adaptation-specific marker)
  - Low ergosterol (2.25)
- WT (non-modified): Moderate diversity (3 sterols)
  - Contains unique sterol: Zymosterol
  - Moderate ergosterol (6.97)

### 4. Adaptation Type Effects on Sterol Diversity
- Temperature adaptation shows **2x higher sterol diversity** than low oxygen adaptation
- Temperature adaptation: 5.0 sterols (mean)
- Low oxygen adaptation: 2.5 sterols (mean)

### 5. Treatment Comparisons
- CAS vs STC: 4.33x difference in ergosterol levels
- CAS vs WT: 1.40x difference in ergosterol levels 
- STC vs WT: 0.32x difference in ergosterol levels (WT has 3.1x more than STC)

## Biological Significance

These findings reveal important patterns in how yeast adapts its sterol composition in response to different environmental stressors and genetic modifications:

1. **Adaptation Strategy Differences**:
   - Temperature adaptation maintains high ergosterol levels with diverse sterol profiles
   - Low oxygen adaptation dramatically reduces ergosterol levels with simplified sterol profiles

2. **Gene Modification Effects**:
   - Gene modification increases sterol diversity rather than directly altering ergosterol content
   - Each modified strain produces unique sterols not found in other treatments

3. **Support for Genomic Conservation Findings**:
   - The sterol profiles align with our genomic findings about purifying selection on the ergosterol pathway
   - Despite gene conservation, sterols show adaptive changes in composition and relative abundance
   - This suggests adaptation occurs through regulatory changes rather than enzyme structure modifications

4. **Temperature vs Low Oxygen Response**:
   - The significant difference in ergosterol levels between temperature and low oxygen adaptation suggests fundamentally different membrane adaptation strategies
   - Temperature adaptation favors diverse sterols and high ergosterol, likely to maintain appropriate membrane fluidity
   - Low oxygen adaptation conserves resources with minimal sterol diversity and lower ergosterol levels

These patterns provide important biochemical evidence connecting our genomic findings to functional adaptations in the yeast cell membrane.
