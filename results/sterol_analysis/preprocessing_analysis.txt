# Sterol Preprocessing Analysis

## Data Summary
The sterol dataset contains 20 sterol measurements across 8 samples:
- 4 different treatments/conditions (CAS, STC, WT-37C, WT-MA)
- 2 generations per treatment (5 and 55)
- 9 unique sterols detected
- Both temperature and low oxygen adaptation represented

## Key Observations from Preprocessing

### 1. Sterol Diversity by Treatment
- **CAS (gene-modified, temperature-adapted)**: Highest sterol diversity (7 sterols)
  - Contains unique sterols: Stigmasta-5_22-dien-3-ol_acetate, Ergosta-7-en-3-ol, Cycloartenol, Ergost-7-en-3beta-ol
- **STC (gene-modified, low oxygen-adapted)**: Lowest diversity (2 sterols)
  - Contains a unique sterol: Tetrahymanol (not found in other treatments)
- **WT (non-modified)**: Moderate diversity varies by condition and generation

### 2. Ergosterol Trends
- **Temperature adaptation**: Generally higher ergosterol levels
  - WT_55_37C has highest ergosterol (12.5 ± 1.5)
  - CAS shows a decrease from generation 5 to 55 (13.0 → 6.5)
- **Low oxygen adaptation**: Generally lower ergosterol levels
  - All low oxygen samples have <5 concentration values
  - WT shows a decrease from generation 5 to 55 (4.4 → 2.0)

### 3. Generation Effects (5 vs 55)
- **Different treatments show opposite generational trends**:
  - WT-37C: Ergosterol increases from gen 5 to 55 (9.0 → 12.5)
  - CAS-37C: Ergosterol decreases from gen 5 to 55 (13.0 → 6.5)
  - WT-MA: Ergosterol decreases from gen 5 to 55 (4.4 → 2.0)
  - STC: Ergosterol decreases from gen 5 to 55 (2.8 → 1.7)

### 4. Adaptation Type Differences
- **Temperature adaptation**:
  - Higher ergosterol levels
  - Presence of Zymosterol and Fecosterol
- **Low oxygen adaptation**:
  - Lower ergosterol levels
  - Presence of Tetrahymanol in STC strain
  
### 5. Gene Modification Effects
- **Modified (CAS, STC)**:
  - More diverse sterol profiles
  - Unique sterols not found in wild-type samples
- **Non-modified (WT)**:
  - Simpler sterol profiles
  - More consistent across conditions

## Implications for Next Analysis Steps

Based on these preliminary findings, the comparative analysis should focus on:

1. **Statistical testing of the key differences**:
   - Temperature vs. low oxygen adaptation effects on ergosterol levels
   - Gene modification effects on sterol diversity
   - Generation effects within each treatment

2. **Pathway analysis considerations**:
   - The presence of diverse intermediates in CAS suggests altered flux through the ergosterol pathway
   - Tetrahymanol in STC suggests a potential pathway divergence under low oxygen conditions
   - Changes in Zymosterol and Fecosterol levels between generations in WT-37C may indicate regulatory shifts

3. **Integration with genomic data**:
   - The unique sterols in gene-modified strains may relate to the satellite gene variants identified in genomic analysis
   - The different generational trends may provide evidence for how adaptation occurs despite conserved ergosterol genes
