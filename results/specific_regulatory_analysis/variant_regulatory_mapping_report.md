## Biological Interpretations

- **Distal Regulatory Focus**: A higher proportion of variants occur in distal regulatory regions rather than coding regions, suggesting adaptation primarily through changes in gene regulation rather than protein structure.
- **Conservation Zone Distribution**: Variants are distributed across buffer zone (44 variants), supporting the four-zone conservation architecture model where adaptation occurs through changes at varying distances from essential genes.
- **Variant Distribution Range**: Variants occur at distances ranging from 89.0bp to 332.0bp from ERG genes, demonstrating a broad spatial distribution of genetic changes that may affect ergosterol pathway function.
- **Hierarchical Regulatory Architecture**: The distribution of variants across different regulatory regions and conservation zones reveals a hierarchical structure that balances essential function preservation with adaptive flexibility.
