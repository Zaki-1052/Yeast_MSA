## Biological Interpretation

- **Treatment-Specific Variant Patterns**:
  - WT-37: 0.0% missense, 0.0% synonymous, 0.0% frameshift, 100.0% regulatory
  - CAS: 0.0% missense, 0.0% synonymous, 0.0% frameshift, 100.0% regulatory
  - STC: 0.0% missense, 0.0% synonymous, 0.0% frameshift, 100.0% regulatory
  - WTA: 0.0% missense, 0.0% synonymous, 0.0% frameshift, 100.0% regulatory
- **Variant Distribution Range**: Variants occur at distances ranging from 89.0bp to 332.0bp from genes, with a mean distance of 180.4bp, demonstrating a broad spatial distribution of genetic changes that may affect gene function.
- **Hierarchical Regulatory Architecture**: The distribution of variants across different effect types and distances from genes reveals a hierarchical structure that balances essential function preservation with adaptive flexibility.
- **Regulatory-Focused Adaptation**: The dominance of regulatory variants over coding changes suggests that adaptation typically occurs through alterations in gene expression rather than through modifications to protein structure and function.
