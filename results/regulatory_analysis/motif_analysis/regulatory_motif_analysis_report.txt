## Biological Interpretation

- **Promoter-Biased Regulation**: A higher proportion of variants occur in promoter/upstream regions, suggesting adaptation through changes in transcriptional regulation rather than post-transcriptional processes.
- **Distal Regulatory Preference**: Variants are more concentrated in UAS regions rather than core promoter elements, suggesting adaptation through modulation of condition-specific transcription factor binding rather than basal transcription machinery.
- **Strong ERG Regulatory Focus**: The high proportion of variants associated with ergosterol pathway genes confirms the central role of sterol metabolism in the adaptive response to the experimental conditions.
