## Biological Interpretation

The extended ergosterol pathway network reveals how adaptation may occur through changes
in the broader genomic neighborhood rather than direct modification of essential pathway genes.

Key observations from the network:

1. Strong conservation of core ergosterol genes is maintained even in this extended view
2. HIGH impact variants appear consistently at specific distances from the pathway genes
3. The network reveals potential regulatory and functional connections between affected genes
   and the ergosterol pathway that may mediate adaptation to stress conditions
4. Treatment-specific patterns of variation suggest distinct adaptation mechanisms for
   temperature vs. oxygen stress, and for different genetic backgrounds (STC, CAS)

This network analysis supports a model where adaptation occurs through coordinated
changes in the extended genomic neighborhood surrounding essential pathways, rather
than through direct modification of core pathway components.
