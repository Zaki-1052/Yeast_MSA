# Analysis of Genes Affected by HIGH/MODERATE Impact Variants Near Ergosterol Pathway
Generated: 2025-05-06 03:49:39

## Overview
No genes were found to be affected by the HIGH/MODERATE impact variants.
This could be due to the variants being in intergenic regions or due to incomplete gene annotations.

## Biological Implications

The absence of identifiable genes affected by these variants suggests that the HIGH/MODERATE impact
variants near ergosterol pathway genes might be affecting intergenic regions or unannotated genes.
This is consistent with our previous finding that the ergosterol pathway itself is under strong
purifying selection, extending to a considerable distance around these genes.
