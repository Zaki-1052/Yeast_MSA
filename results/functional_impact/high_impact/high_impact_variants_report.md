## No HIGH or MODERATE Impact Variants Found

No variants with HIGH or MODERATE impact were found in the analyzed ergosterol pathway genes.
This suggests strong purifying selection on these genes, reinforcing our earlier findings
that the ergosterol pathway genes are highly conserved even under adaptive conditions.

This observation is consistent with the essential role of ergosterol in yeast cell membranes
and suggests that adaptation may occur primarily through changes in gene expression rather
than through protein-altering mutations.

Key implications:

1. The ergosterol pathway appears to be under strong purifying selection
2. Adaptation likely occurs through gene expression changes rather than protein alterations
3. This finding is consistent with the critical role of ergosterol in membrane integrity
4. It reinforces our earlier observation of predominantly regulatory variants in these genes
