# Yeast MSA Project: Overview

## Project Purpose

This project investigates how yeast (*S. cerevisiae*, W303 strain) adapts to different environmental stresses through genetic mutations. The research employs comparative genomic analysis to study variations between yeast strains subjected to different treatments - temperature stress, low oxygen conditions, and gene modifications.

The primary focus is on understanding how mutations in the ergosterol pathway (a critical pathway for membrane adaptation) respond to environmental stress. The project reveals a fascinating pattern of conservation in essential pathway genes, where purifying selection maintains their integrity while allowing adaptive changes in regulatory regions and "satellite" genes.

## Core Goals

1. Identify and characterize mutations in different treatment conditions
2. Analyze mutation spectrum patterns and sequence contexts
3. Detect regional enrichment of mutations across the genome
4. Compare population structures between different treatment groups
5. Understand the influence of gene modifications on adaptation mechanisms
6. Analyze functional impacts of variants in the ergosterol pathway genes
7. Investigate network relationships between core pathway genes and affected neighboring genes
8. Characterize purifying selection and adaptive mechanisms at the gene level
9. Correlate genomic findings with biochemical adaptations in sterol profiles
10. Understand the hierarchical conservation architecture in essential pathways

## Experimental Design

The project analyzes four main treatment conditions:

1. **WT-37**: Wild-type yeast adapted to higher temperature (37°C)
   - Adaptation: Temperature
   - Gene Modification: None

2. **WTA**: Wild-type yeast adapted to low oxygen conditions
   - Adaptation: Low Oxygen
   - Gene Modification: None

3. **STC**: Strain containing squalene tetrahymanol cyclase gene
   - Adaptation: Low Oxygen
   - Gene Modification: STC gene (non-yeast origin)

4. **CAS**: Strain containing cycloartenol synthase gene
   - Adaptation: Temperature (37°C)
   - Gene Modification: CAS gene (non-yeast origin)

Each treatment includes control samples (WT-CTRL, STC-CTRL, CAS-CTRL) and three biological replicates. This design enables multiple comparison approaches: treatment vs. control, temperature vs. low oxygen adaptation, gene-modified vs. non-modified strains, and direct treatment pair comparisons.

## Key Findings Overview

- Strong evidence of purifying selection in ergosterol pathway genes
- Core pathway genes show remarkable conservation across all conditions
- Most genetic variation occurs in regulatory regions and "satellite genes"
- A four-layered conservation architecture was identified
- Temperature and low oxygen adaptations show distinct mutation patterns
- Genetic changes correlate with specific biochemical adaptation in sterol profiles
- Gene-modified strains show unique mutation patterns compared to wild-type strains
