## Project Summary

This project investigates how yeast (S. cerevisiae, W303 strain) adapts to different environmental stresses through genetic mutations. The research employs comparative genomic analysis to study variations between yeast strains subjected to different treatments - temperature stress, low oxygen conditions, and gene modifications.

The core focus is on understanding how mutations in the ergosterol pathway (a critical pathway for membrane adaptation) respond to environmental stress. The analysis reveals a fascinating pattern of conservation in essential pathway genes, where purifying selection appears to be maintaining their integrity while allowing adaptive changes in regulatory regions and "satellite" genes.

## Key Discoveries

1. **Hierarchical Conservation Architecture**: A four-layered conservation pattern that balances essential function preservation with adaptive flexibility
   
2. **Regulatory Adaptation Mechanism**: Adaptation occurs primarily through changes in gene regulation rather than protein structure
   
3. **Satellite Gene Function**: "Satellite genes" at consistent distances from pathway genes enable adaptation while preserving core functions
   
4. **Treatment-Specific Adaptations**: Different stress conditions trigger distinct genomic and biochemical responses
   
5. **Correlation with Sterol Profiles**: Genetic changes correlate with specific biochemical adaptations in membrane composition
