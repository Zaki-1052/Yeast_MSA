# New Regulatory Analysis Planning Document

## Background and Rationale

The current regulatory analysis approach has provided valuable insights but has several limitations that need to be addressed in a new, more comprehensive framework. The observed phenomenon of 80% of variants near ergosterol genes being found in regulatory regions rather than protein-coding sequences suggests that adaptation occurs primarily through changes in gene expression rather than protein structure. This requires a more sophisticated analytical approach to fully understand the regulatory mechanisms involved in adaptation.

## Objectives of the New Regulatory Analysis

1. **Precise Mapping of Regulatory Features**: Map variants to specific regulatory elements with higher resolution and biological context
2. **Transcription Factor Binding Site (TFBS) Analysis**: Identify affected TFBS and their biological significance
3. **Regulatory Network Modeling**: Construct regulatory networks connecting ERG and OSH genes
4. **Adaptation-Specific Regulatory Patterns**: Identify regulatory changes specific to temperature vs. low oxygen adaptation
5. **Statistical Validation**: Apply rigorous statistical analysis to establish significance of regulatory patterns
6. **Integration with Four-Zone Architecture**: Connect regulatory findings with the hierarchical conservation model

## Biological Significance

This improved regulatory analysis will provide deeper insights into how yeast adapts to environmental stresses through regulatory changes rather than alterations to protein structure. By connecting regulatory changes to the four-zone conservation architecture, we can understand how organisms maintain essential functions while enabling adaptation through carefully controlled regulatory mechanisms. The analysis of ERG-OSH regulatory relationships will further illuminate the coordination between sterol synthesis and transport in membrane adaptation.

This approach moves beyond simple variant counting to a biologically informed analysis of regulatory mechanisms, providing a more complete understanding of adaptation through gene expression changes rather than protein alterations. The integration with our existing findings will create a comprehensive model of yeast adaptation that connects genomic changes to regulatory mechanisms and ultimately to phenotypic outcomes.
