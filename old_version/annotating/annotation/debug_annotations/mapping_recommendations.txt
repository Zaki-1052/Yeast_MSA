Gene Mapping Recommendations
==============================================

Based on the debug analysis, here are the key findings:

1. VCF File Access:
   - VCF files are accessible with zcat

2. Current Gene Mappings:
   - YHR072W → w303_scaffold_80 (Confidence: High)
   - YHR007C → w303_scaffold_139 (Confidence: High)
   - YNL280C → w303_scaffold_15 (Confidence: High)

3. Observed Gene ID Patterns:
   - No clear gene ID patterns observed

4. Recommendations for next steps:
   a. Manually check the GenBank files with grep for each target gene
      Example: grep -A 10 -B 10 'YHR190W' /Users/zakiralibhai/snpEff/data/w303/genes.gbk
   b. Try extracting the LOCUS line before each gene reference
   c. Look for gene name patterns in the SnpEff database dump
   d. Consider a more aggressive grep for partial matches
   e. For unmapped genes, try using other genes on the same chromosome as guides
