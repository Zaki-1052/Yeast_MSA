SnpEff Chromosome Naming Issue Recommendation
Date: 2025-04-13 21:43:18
==============================================

ISSUE DIAGNOSIS:
The chromosome names in your VCF files don't match the chromosome names in the SnpEff database.

RECOMMENDED SOLUTION OPTIONS:

OPTION 1: Modify the VCF files to use the chromosome names from the SnpEff database
- Extract a complete list of chromosome names from the SnpEff database
- Create a comprehensive mapping between your VCF chromosomes and SnpEff chromosomes
- Use bcftools to reheader the VCF files with the correct chromosome names

OPTION 2: Rebuild the SnpEff database using the GenBank files with JRIU identifiers
- The genes.gbk file already contains JRIU identifiers, but the database might not be properly built
- Delete the existing w303 database and rebuild it using the correct GenBank files

OPTION 3: Use a different annotation tool that can handle the chromosome name mismatch
- Tools like VEP or ANNOVAR might be more flexible with chromosome name mappings
- You could also use a tool like vcfanno with a custom annotation file

NEXT STEPS:
1. Run a detailed comparison between the exact chromosome names in your VCF files and the SnpEff database
2. If there's a consistent pattern, create a comprehensive mapping file
3. Use bcftools reheader to rename chromosomes in your VCF files
4. Try a test annotation on a single modified VCF to verify the fix
