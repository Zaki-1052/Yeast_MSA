Gene Mapping Recommendations
==============================================

The SnpEff database uses different gene identifiers than the SGD-style YHR190W format.
To find variants in your genes of interest, you'll need to:

1. Identify the corresponding W303 identifiers for your target genes
   - Look in the genes.gbk file for product or note fields containing your gene names
   - Search for gene descriptions or aliases that match your genes
   - Fill in the manual_mapping_template.tsv file with the correct mappings

2. Update your gene extraction script to:
   - Use the W303 gene identifiers instead of SGD names
   - Extract the correct field from the ANN string (appears to be field 4)
   - Map back to the SGD names in your final output

3. Alternative approaches:
   - Run SnpEff on the VCF files with the -canon option to get canonical gene names
   - Use an external database to map between identifier systems
   - Create a custom annotation using BED files with your genes of interest
