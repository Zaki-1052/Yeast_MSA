Clustering and PCA Analysis:
-------------------------
1. PCA analysis highlights the major axes of variation in the dataset.
2. Hierarchical clustering reveals sample groups based on genetic similarity.
3. Samples tend to cluster by adaptation type, suggesting that temperature and
   low oxygen adaptations involve distinct genomic changes.
4. Gene-modified strains show specific population structure characteristics
   compared to their non-modified counterparts.

Main Conclusions:
---------------
1. This analysis examines the genetic relationships between samples based on their variant profiles.
2. Principal Component Analysis reveals the major axes of variation in the dataset.
3. Hierarchical clustering identifies sample groups based on genetic similarity.
4. Treatment-specific variant patterns provide insights into adaptation mechanisms.
5. Temperature and low oxygen adaptations show distinct population structures,
   suggesting different evolutionary trajectories.
6. Gene modifications influence variant profiles and population structure,
   potentially through interactions with adaptation mechanisms.
