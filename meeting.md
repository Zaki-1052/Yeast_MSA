Sterol Biosynthesis…a history of molecular evolution 
Now this is a very  simplified schematic of sterol biosynthesis. What you see here is essentially how sterol biosynthesis has evolved over the course of the development of eukaryotes and the  planet over billions of years. 
Sterols play a role in raft formation
What Bloch did not know is that besides membrane ordering sterols also serve an additional biophysical role, being involved in lipid raft formation which has been characterized for cholesterol in model membrane systems notably by Sarah Keller. Now lipid rafts are difficult to study in mammalian cells but fortunately the yeast vacuole is one system in which we can study rafts. They generally form these rafts under nutrient depletion conditions. 
Ergosterol structure is optimized to interact with saturated lipids (sphingolipids)
Now going off that, ergosterol is optimized to interact with saturated lipids, and the yeast sphingolipids, another lipid ingredient to form rafts are highly saturated. If we completely genetically replace ergosterol with other eukaryotic sterols such as cholesterol or campesterol, we see that the vacuole fails to under lipid raft formation highlighting the structural requirement needed to form rafts. This idea has been theorized about 15 years ago and a model that has yet to be really looked into is here highlighting in this case the methylation of gthe ergosterol tail may enable better interaction with its partner sphingolipid compared to other sterols lacking that methylation.

Demethylations improve the ordering capacity of sterols
Demethylations shape the sterol topology
The demethylations of cholesterol highlight its structure-function relationship. Here we have cholesterol and its bi-facial topology of its ring structure. The smooth alpha face is the result of demethylations of its biosynthesis, enabling for VDW interactions with phospholipids whereas the rough beta face contains two vestigial methyl groups from the lanosterol step which serve to help orient cholesterol in the bilayer. 
Bloch hypothesis
These demethylations which are conserved across the various sterol biosynthetic pathways which led Konrad Bloch to propose that sterol structure evolved to improve membrane properties, primarily during his time membrane ordering, an idea known as the bloch hypothesis 
Sterol structure evolved to improve membrane properties (ordering)
Sterol structure influences biophysical fitness
These demethylations which are conserved across the various sterol biosynthetic pathways which led Konrad Bloch to propose that sterol structure evolved to improve membrane properties, primarily during his time membrane ordering, an idea known as the bloch hypothesis 
Making rafts in vitro

Not all sterols promote rafts or form rafts
Rafts in vivo
What Bloch did not know is that besides membrane ordering sterols also serve an additional biophysical role, being involved in lipid raft formation which has been characterized for cholesterol in model membrane systems notably by Sarah Keller. Now lipid rafts are difficult to study in mammalian cells but fortunately the yeast vacuole is one system in which we can study rafts. They generally form these rafts under nutrient depletion conditions. 
Revisiting the Bloch hypothesis in the lipid raft era
Learning all this at the start of my PhD, I wanted to take advantage of both the synthetic and living systems and revisiting Bloch's hypothesis in the context of lipid rafts.

Basically hone in that it’s a strightfoward experiment with the exception of purifying out enough IPC…which isn’t a problem either at this point.

Overview of OSH protein family
Osh4p moves ergosterol from the ER, where it’s made, to the Golgi and vesicles beyond, while transporting PI(4)P back to the ER. Osh1p helps bridge the ER and Golgi by binding PI(4)P at the Golgi Osh1p can also relocate to ER–vacuole junctions by interacting with Nvj1p, potentially performing a similar exchange there. Osh2p is found at ER–plasma membrane contact sites and binds Myo5p to deliver ergosterol to endocytic sites, possibly through sterol and PI(4)P exchange. Osh6p and Osh7p transfer phosphatidylserine (PS), made in the ER, to the plasma membrane by swapping it with PI(4)P. They bind to Ist2p to stay at ER–PM contact sites. OSH5 got Ceramide probe to screen for trafficking defects

Ergosterol structure is optimized to interact with saturated lipids (sphingolipids)
Now going off that, ergosterol is optimized to interact with saturated lipids, and the yeast sphingolipids, another lipid ingredient to form rafts are highly saturated. If we completely genetically replace ergosterol with other eukaryotic sterols such as cholesterol or campesterol, we see that the vacuole fails to under lipid raft formation highlighting the structural requirement needed to form rafts. This idea has been theorized about 15 years ago and a model that has yet to be really looked into is here highlighting in this case the methylation of gthe ergosterol tail may enable better interaction with its partner sphingolipid compared to other sterols lacking that methylation. 

Structural dissection of ergosterol
This is an extremely simplified view of the work that went into this paper that will be out next week in science advances but to summarize, I generated a sterol library of yeast strains assessed the frequency of lipid raft domains in the vacuole, extracted the sterols of some of these strains to see if I get something similar when using the sterols in giant vesicles and finally pulling all the biophysical data I gathered for our collaborator to do simulations. We find here that the structure of ergosterol produces an intermediate ordering effect, that isn't too ordered or too fluid like its precursors which aids in its ability to make rafts. 

Sterols confer advantageous phenotypes
The sterol landscape is vast and largely unknown…
Now for a little bit of the current directions…here are some other things I've been working on. Now sterols confer some degree of robustness under environmental stress conditions such as tetrahymanol being a potential replacement for ergosterol under low oxygen conditions. I have several adapated yeast strains and Im currently looking through changes in ergosterol genes in addition to sterol profiles and vacuole morphology of these strains.Now for the second bit, I'm also looking at how osh proeins, a family of lipid transport proteins affect lipid raft domain frequency and morphology and whats interesting in that regard is that sterol transport is mainly driven by another lipid transport protein to the vacuole so seeing these lipid raft frequency changes suggests they must be playing a role.
